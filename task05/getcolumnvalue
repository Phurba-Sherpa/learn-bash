The file used in Task 4-1 is actually a report derived from a bigger table of data about
albums. This table consists of several columns, or fields, to which a user refers by
names like “artist,” “title,” “year,” etc. The columns are separated by vertical bars (|,
the same as the UNIX pipe character). To deal with individual columns in the table,
field names need to be converted to field numbers.
Suppose there is a shell function called getfield that takes the field name as argument
and writes the corresponding field (or column) number on the standard output. Use
this routine to help extract a column from the data table.
