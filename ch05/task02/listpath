Task 4-4 used pattern matching and substitution to list the directories in PATH, one
to a line. Unfortunately, old versions of bash donâ€™t have that particular pattern operator. Write a general shell script, listpath, that prints each directory in PATH, one per
line. In addition, have it print out information about each directory, such as the permissions and the modification times.

WHAT DO WE KNOW?
1. $PATH - a system variable, that stores the list of dir separated by `:`
2. We also know we need to use for loop, both $PATH isnt array , so what do we do now?
'
for dir in $PATH
do 
if [ -z "$dir" ]; then dir.;fi

if ! [ e "$dir" ]; then
echo "$dir: Doesnt' exits"
elif ! [ -d "$dir" ]; then 
echo "$dir isn't Directory"
else
ls -ld $dir
fi
done
