It is possible to print out all of the directories below a given one by using the -R option
of ls. Unfortunately, this doesnâ€™t give much idea about the directory structure because
it prints all the files and directories line by line. Write a script that performs a recursive
directory listing and produces output that gives an idea of the structure for a small
number of subdirectories.

1. we want to list all ls all content of present dir
2. check if dir, the we again list 
3.

list=$(ls)

for dir in $list; do
    echo "  $dir" 
    if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
        sdl=$(ls $dir)
        for sb in "$sdl"; do
            echo "  $sb"
        done
    fi
done
